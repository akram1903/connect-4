2.representation:
class game-> int play= 1->7
             int state  ##convert to 2d list ((((DONE!!))))
             int parent
             int child='none'
             boolean turn= false->red //// true->yellow *dh 34an n3rf el le3ba el gaya ll yellow wla el red

3. 0->none
   1->human
   2->AI


4. int winner:
   0->draw
   1->human
   2->AI


5.three algorithms :
(1).minimax without alphabeta pruning   data structure-> ?????   parameters-> fun(self,state:State,depth:int,maximizingPlayer:bool)
(2).Minimax with alpha-beta pruning     data structure-> ?????   parameters-> fun(self,state:State,depth:int,maximizingPlayer:bool)
(3).Expected Minimax (random move)      data structure-> ?????   parameters-> fun(self,state:State,depth:int,maximizingPlayer:bool)

6.(3)expected minimax->add 2 integer var:left and right to dedicate wich is better and return to akram GUI only the column that i will play

7.use many height and comment on each height of the tree used and present the best preformance height

8.range->20sec for each move and if it excceded then edit the code  

9.heuristic -> ?????????     



requirment::::
1.game GUI
2.tree in each state of any algorithm
3.(bonus)->tree is printed using GUI
4.(bonus)->on the least heurisitc function


Akram:
.GUI
.minimax without alphabeta pruning
.data structure-> ?????
.parameters-> fun(self,state:State,depth:int,maximizingPlayer:bool)
.returns-> last State in depth (decrements on child) = 0 which points on its parent
print the time taken when ai is playing his round using different depth from (3 to 7)
heuristic -> ????


Mohamed:
.Minimax with alpha-beta pruning
.data structure-> ?????
.parameters-> fun(self,state:State,depth:int,maximizingPlayer:bool)
.returns-> last State in depth (decrements on child) = 0 which points on its parent
print the time taken when ai is playing his round using different depth from (3 to 7)
heuristic -> ????

Ashraf:
.Expected Minimax (random move)
.data structure-> ?????
.parameters-> fun(self,state:State,depth:int,maximizingPlayer:bool)
.returns-> last State in depth (decrements on child) = 0 which points on its parent
print the time taken when ai is playing his round using different depth from (3 to 7)
heuristic -> ????

side note:  made a folder named minimax and each contributor should put his algorithm class inside it
            added a heuristic function inside class State, we should discuss its best design and implementation
